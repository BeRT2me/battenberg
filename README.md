Milhoja is a tool in top of [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) which maintains
directory templating with Git. The first goal of Milhoja is to provide *upgrade* feature to [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter).

## Usage

Install a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
template on current directory:

    ```bash
    milhoja install <your cookiecutter>
    ```

Specify a target reference (branch, tag, commit):

    ```bash
    milhoja install -c v1.0.0 <your cookiecutter>
    ```

Show installed template:

    ```bash
    milhoja show
    ```

Install a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template on your existing Git repository:

    ```bash
    milhoja -C <your repo path> install <your cookiecutter>
    ```

Upgrade your repository with last version of template:

    ```bash
    milhoja -C <your repo path> upgrade
    ```

## Development

To get set up run:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

    # Install in editable mode so you get the updates propagated.
    pip install -e .

    # If you want to be able to run tests & linting install via:
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

Then to actually perform any operations just use the `milhoja` command which should now be on your `$PATH`.

To run tests:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

To run linting:

    ```bash
    flake8 --config flake8.cfg
    ```
